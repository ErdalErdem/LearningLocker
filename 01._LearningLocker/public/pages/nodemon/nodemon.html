        <h3>Nodemon</h3>
        <p>
            Nodemon is a tool for Node.js development that automatically 
            monitors file changes in your Node.js application and restarts 
            the server every time you save changes to your files. This is convenient 
            when you're developing your application, as it saves you the hassle of manually 
            restarting the server after each change in your code..</p>

<pre>
<code>
    npm install nodemon
or for global installation: npm install -g nodemon
</code>
