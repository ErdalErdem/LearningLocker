        <h3>Git</h3>
        <p>
            Git acts as a version tracking system, giving you the power to 
            closely follow changes in your code. It's a crucial tool for guarding 
            against errors, making sure you can always return to earlier versions if the 
            latest updates don't succeed.

            Here are some commands that we were taught, as they are important
            and gives us the ability to add, commit and push our code to Github
        </p>

    git commit -m fx (“Create text.file”)
